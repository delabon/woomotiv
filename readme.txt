**Almost 97%~ of visitors**, stop by, they click around and they leave without buying a product or a service. All online stores face this particular problem. **Which, is the lack of TRUST.**

Luckily, this is something that can be improved a lot with the use of **Woocommerce social proof**.

**Dr.Robert Cialdini**
